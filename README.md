# CodeNames
This program will allow the user to play CodeNames.

The CodeNames.py plays CodeNames through the command line.  
Currently working on building a GUI using tkinter (gui.py and gui2.py).

New version of this game in the hackathon directory. Using the codeNames_kivy.py file.
  - it currently provides a basic implementation with the kivy library 
  - Future additions:
      - add separate spymaster screen
      - make the interface a bit nicer
      - make better graphics
